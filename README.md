# THIS IS A SCRIPT TO SORT PHOTOS BY THE DATE THEY WERE TAKEN
# 28.12.2019
=============================================================

SortPhotos takes a folder and renames the photos with ascending numbers
corresponding to the date they were taken. It does allow to shift the
dates in case one of the cameras has the wrong date/time. However, 
internally the date is not changed, it is only shifted for the purpose
to correctly rename them with ascending numbers.
The use is on the full responsability of the user. I do not take any
responsability for the consequences following from using or downloading
this script.
